    <h3 class="text-2xl">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h3><br>
    <h4 class="text-xl">Answer: <br><br>


        In JavaScript, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in the code. <br> There are three types of
        variable scope in JavaScript. 
        Those are Global scope, Function scope and Block scope.

        <br><br>
        Global scope: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope. <br> They can be accessed from anywhere
        in the code, including other functions. <br>
        <br>
        Function scope: Variables declared inside a function have function scope. <br> They can only be accessed from within
        the function that they are declared in. <br><br>

        Block scope: Variables declared within a block of code, such as a for loop or an if statement, <br> have block scope.
        They can only be accessed from within the block that they are declared in.
        <br><br>
        var is a function scope keyword.
        
        let and const those are block scope keyword.

    <h3 class="text-2xl">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h3><br>
    <h4 class="text-xl">Answer: <br><br>

        To represent the absence of a value. Null and undefined are both used to represent the absence of a value. <br>
        However, they have different meanings. Null is used to represent the intentional absence of a value, <br>
        while undefined is used to represent the unintentional absence of a value. <br>
        <br>
        If i use null to declare a empty variable program will run successfully. <br> But if i use undefine the code
        will return error. <br>
        So in every case to declare a empty variable we should use null.

    <h3 class="text-2xl ">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h3><br>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Answer: <br>
        <br> REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. <br>
        It allows applications or devices to communicate with each other using HTTP methods and JSON format. <br>
        It follows some principles to make the communication between a client and a server simple and uniform. <br> For
        example, a REST API can use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.
        <br> A
        resource is anything that can be identified by a URL, such as a user, a product, or a blog post.
